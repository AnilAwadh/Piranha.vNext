<p>
	This is a <strong>complete rewrite</strong> of Piranha CMS in order to achieve a more simple, flexible
	and future proof architecture. The framework is database &amp; authentication agnostic with simple provider
	interfaces that makes sure that it can be adapted to different architectures.
</p>

<h2>Licensing</h2>
<p>
	Piranha CMS uses two different licenses. The <strong>core libraries</strong> are released under the
	<strong>LGPL</strong> license which is a <strong>weak copyleft</strong> license intended for software libraries.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		"Weak copyleft" licenses are generally used for the creation of software libraries, to allow other software '
		to link to the library, and then be redistributed without the legal requirement for the work to be distributed
		under the library's copyleft license. Only changes to the weak-copylefted software itself become subject to the
		copyleft provisions of such a license, not changes to the software that links to it.
	</p>

</p>
<p>
	Everything else is released under the <strong>MIT</strong> license granting you permission to do pretty much anything you want.
</p>
<h3>Why LGPL?</h3>
<p>
	The reason for choosing this license is simple. I wrote this software intending that it should be <strong>free of charge</strong>
	and <strong>available for everyone</strong>. I did <strong>not</strong> write it so that the source code could be modified
	and used to create commercial proprietary products.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
	This version doesn't in any way have the same set of features as the currently released version of Piranha CMS.
	In order to get the community involved I wanted to release the source code as soon as possible to get as many
	contributors as possible.
</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

	You can find the roadmap under <strong>Milestones</strong> in this repository.
